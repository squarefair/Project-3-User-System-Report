I see that there is a request for me to make a program that will track certain occurances in a documentation system. I think I will use a stack data structure. From top to bottom would be suspicious activity, irresponsible behavior, system glitch, domain count, and additional insights. I will need to import/ open the user log to analyze using my program. As for functions I will be using, I will need to use if statments for all of the 5 activites needed to be recorded, if statments are the start of making a program. I will need to use else statements when a user is doing suspicious or iresonsible things (when they go out of the time frame). I think it would make thing easier if I used def to make these 5 report features, for example def suspicious_report.txt:. I would define these five things in diffrent cells. For domain count I will need to  use .read . For system glitches, those will be included in else statements. Of course I will need print statements to display the log after the information has been processed. As for additional insights I will try to make those later.
